# Basic Text RPG For Practicing

Reference from (https://www.youtube.com/@CodeTechandTutorials)

## Concepts:
- **Warrior**: High Phy Damage, HP growth should be ~19
- **Mage**: High Mag Damage, HP growth should be ~12
- **trickster**: Damage with probability(not implemented for now)

## How it works:
 - Stats:
    - Strength
    - intelligence
    - experience
 - Leveling: gets experience when you defeat mobs or do a particular task 
 - Tech-tree(to be implemented)
 - skills: basic spells for mages and 
 - moving from one place to other: also in text
 - 턴제, 전투도 똑같이 처리, 일단 스탯은 기본적으로 다 비슷하게 해놓고
